Currently, I'm focused on the next generation threat detection and runtime security tools for cloud native applications as well as software supply chain security. I want to leverage my system programming and BPF experience to work on disruptive technologies. I'm also learning all the time to have deeper understanding of underlying technologies, cyber attack techniques and tactics, and to take my skills to the next level.
