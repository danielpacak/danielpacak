I'm currently with Cycode working on cybersecurity products. In particular, I'm focused on agent-based software supply chain security.
This involves kernel programming in C and eBPF, as well as Go and JavaScript/TypeScript programming in user space.
I do lots of integrations with CI/CD platforms such as GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipelines.
This technology stack is something that I'm building my strength in.

I'm learning Rust, Linux programming interfaces, as well as Linux network and file system internals.

During my time at Aqua Security, I designed and implemented Starboard as a Kubernetes native security manager. Starboard has pivoted and was renamed to Trivy Operator without preserving commits history. I also used to maintain the who-can plugin for kubectl that facilitates RBAC permissions management in Kubernetes. I'm Certified Kubernetes Applications Developer (CKAD) and Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA).

I'm an emeritus maintainer of CNCF project Harbor where I fouced on vulnerability scanning, designing pluggable scanners API, and onboarding
Trivy as the default vulnerability scanner.
